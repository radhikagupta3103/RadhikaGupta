## 👩🏻‍💻About Me

Senior Data Scientist with 5+ years of experience leading end to end analytics initiatives across Risk, Fraud, Marketing Analytics, and Enterprise Data Platforms.

I specialize in translating complex, large scale datasets into production grade machine learning systems and executive level decision intelligence. My work bridges advanced modeling with measurable business outcomes optimizing risk strategy, improving operational efficiency, and driving revenue growth.

💡 Core Strengths:

- Risk & Fraud Modeling Strategy

- Production ML Systems & Model Governance

- Scalable Data Architecture & Warehousing

- Cross-functional Stakeholder Leadership

- KPI Design & Executive Reporting

🚀 I build solutions that move beyond experimentation — delivering scalable, monitored, business-aligned data products.

✨ I believe data science is not just modeling — it’s influencing strategic decisions at scale.
